IDE -> Integrated Development Environment
SDK | JDK (version of Java is nothing but Version of JDK)
JDK of 20,17,15 having breakdown features
JDK-> Java Development Kit | JRE-> Java Runtime Environment | JVM-> Java Virtual Machine
SDK-> Software Development Kit

JRE vs JVM vs JDK
JRE => Having class Libraries,It includes JVM in it, Tools in it
JVM => Place to run or execute the java applications (Platform Independent)
    => can run bytecode file,class loader ,heap, stack memory
JDK => It includes JRE in it, contains Development tools

simple.java => compiler => simple.class(bytecodes) => run (JVM)

Objected Oriented Languages => Considered each and every element is called as object
Java is platform independent language => it can run on any OS because of bytecode structure
API => Application Program interface
WORA => write once and run anywhere

Java Used in:
standalone
web application=> spring, hibernate
Enterprise
Mobile application => Android, iOS

Object | Classes

Dog => states/properties => legs,ears,color,breed,name
    => behaviours => barking, eating, sniffing

Class => blueprint => legs,ears,color,breed,name
                   =>  barking, eating, sniffing

Object => Dog

Access Modifier (Class, variable, method, constructor) they manage to access these
                default => if we don't mention it
                private => class only
                public => anyone
                protected => package and subclass

Non-Access Modifier
    Static
    Final
    abstract
    (synchronised, volatile) => used in threats

You can have multiple main methods in java just but changing parameters(String args[]) - IMP

Types of Variables => Changes with Placement of Day1.Variable
local
instance
static

Private is recommended for the instance variable (call must by using object variable)
Static variable can be shared by all copies of methods (i.e.., That can be called without calling the object variable)
local variable must be initialized (call must by using object variable)

Data Types => primitive -> int,double,float,char
           => non-primitive(Data Structures) -> String, Array, list

Operators  => arithmetic, boolean, comparative, logical

type casting =>widening ,narrowing
byte - short - char - int - long - float - double
--->>>> widening (automatically)
                                narrowing(manually) <<<----

-----------Day-2-----------

Do local variable have default value ? No, It can be possible in only static and Instance
Can local variable can be accessed from other methods? -- Yes, by calling an object

local variable dont need access modifiers and static,Instance variable need access modifiers

Loops

for loop -> for(initialize expr;test expr;update expr){
    statements to execute
}

while loop

-----------Day-3-----------

Switchcase --> Alternative of if-else ladder

Arrays:
    non primitive data types => bcoz.. they are not predefined
    contains elements of same datatype
    is an object, length method instead of size
    contiquous memory location => by indexing

One Dimensional Array:
    declaration : datatype[] arrayname; (or) datatype arrayname[]; => pointing reference
    instantiating the array : arrayname = new datatype[length];
    initialize : arrayname = {1,2,3,4,5};
    int[] arr= new int[]{4,5,6,7};
    int[] arr = {1,2,3,4,5,6}; // this is accepted in the modern java

. . Java is pass by value but inside it is pass by reference

Disadvantage of array :
    fixed size we can't alter the size of array once it fixed

Day3.Strings:

Comparasion =>  == (or) .equals()

-----------Day-4-----------

Encapsulation : hiding certain information to user or giving some access to data

bundling or organising data or properties or fields and functions or method => single unit

class. its own fields and methods

data hiding

placing instance variables in private

getter and setter methods.

Immutable classes => one they are set then we can't change the values
    - It can be attained by removing set methods only
    - only get methods
    or - class final, properties => private or final, donot provider setter methods, only getter methods

Inheritance :
    - one class (subclass or child) inherit properties and methods from the another class(parent or superclass)
    Two types or inheritance - single and multilevel inheritance
is - a relationship
vehicle => car,bus,cycle
car
